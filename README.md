**NTUT Program Assignment** provides a better look UI and account management for everyone to submit their homework elegantly. 

## Installation
Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/YFHD-osu/NTUT-Program-Assignment/releases) and install it.

## Platforms
This project will support ``Windows`` initially, ``macOS``, ``Linux`` might be added to the support list in the future. <br>

However, ``web``, ``android``, ``iOS``, are not planned to be support, reasons listed below:

### Web
"The NTUT program assignment website does not allow CORS requests. Due to the security policies of most browsers, sending an HTTP packet from a different origin to a host is not possible. Therefore, the web app will not be feasible until teacher changes the headers of the site.

### Android, iOS
"There is no reason you need to use this app on a mobile device since most people don't use their phones to write programs. Technically, the mobile platform is supported, but it is not required.
